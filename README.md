#### **Several types and forms of computer tests**

The Stress repository contains several scripts for testing computer systems. So far only the following are included:

* /dev/urandom Test

Please note that the tests are not neccesarily producing accurate results and they do not rank you giving out results such as _"Good", "Average", "Bad"_, etc. The output is usually a number and only by comparing to other machines can you determine how good it is. Also, some tests may employ the use of a random factor. The result could vary depending on a computer's random generation algorithm, and also may vary heavily from execution to execution.
